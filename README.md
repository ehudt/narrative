narrative
=========

Want to write a program? Want to write a story? Why not both?

Many people think that in order to be a fine programmer, one must also be a good writer. narrative programming language takes this notion to the next level - All narrative programs are stories and all stories are narrative programs, and should be judged by their literary quality as much as by their functionality.

Language syntax
===============

Technically speaking, narrative presents an alternative, more creative syntax to the widely-used brainfuck programming language. Only, instead of being minimalistic, it is quite the opposite. Every word in your story represents a single instruction (equivalent to a brainfuck instruction), determined by its first letter.

Specification
=============
