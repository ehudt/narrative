narrative
=========

Want to write a program? Want to write a story? Why not both?

Many people think that in order to be a fine programmer, one must also be a good writer. narrative programming language takes this notion to the next level - All narrative programs are stories and all stories are narrative programs, and should be judged by their literary quality as much as by their functionality.

Language syntax
---------------

Technically speaking, narrative presents an alternative, more creative syntax to the widely-used brainfuck programming language. Only, instead of being minimalistic, it is quite the opposite. Every word in your story represents a single instruction (equivalent to a brainfuck instruction), determined by its first letter.

Specification
-------------

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Opening letter</th>
    <th>Brainfuck equivalent</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>e, r, u, v</td>
    <th>+</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>t, d, m ,k</td>
    <th>-</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a, l, w, j</td>
    <th>&gt;</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>o, c, f, x</td>
    <th>&lt;</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>i, g, q</td>
    <th>[</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>n, y, z</td>
    <th>]</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>s, p</td>
    <th>.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>h, b</td>
    <th>,</th>
  </tr>
</table>
